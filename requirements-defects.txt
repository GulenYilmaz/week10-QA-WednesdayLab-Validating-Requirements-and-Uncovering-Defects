Validating Requirements and Uncovering Defects
You now have a new version of Employee Manager (https://devmountain-qa.github.io/employee-manager-v2/), version 2.0 has a persistent database that you can use to add, edit, save and even delete certain employees! (You’ll likely see some fun employees that have been added by students before you.)

Your job is to validate these new requirements, and write up a new test plan with version 2.0’s requirements.
